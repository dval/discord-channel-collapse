# discord-channel-collapse
Allows the channels sidebar to be collapsed.

This Chrome Extension adds a button to the Discord toolbar that lets you toggle the visibility of the channels sidebar.

It's just one simple script that adds an SVG icon, and provides a click listener to set the sidebar width.

Enjoy more screen space on narrow viewports, or just hide the list until you need it.
